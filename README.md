# TILT: A GDPR-Aligned Transparency Information Language and Toolkit for Practical Privacy Engineering

![](overview.png)

We present TILT, a transparency information language and toolkit explicitly designed to represent and process transparency information in line with the requirements of the **GDPR** and allowing for a more automated and adaptive use of such information than established, legalese data protection policies do.

We provide a detailed analysis of transparency obligations from the GDPR to identify the expressiveness required for a **formal transparency language** intended to meet respective legal requirements. In addition, we identify a set of further, non-functional requirements that need to be met to foster practical adoption in real-world (web) information systems engineering. On this basis, we specify our formal language and present a respective, **fully implemented toolkit** around it. We then evaluate the practical applicability of our language and toolkit and demonstrate the additional prospects it unlocks through two different use cases: a) the **inter-organizational analysis of personal data-related practices** allowing, for instance, to uncover data sharing networks based on explicitly announced transparency information and b) the **presentation of formally represented transparency information to users through novel, more comprehensible, and potentially adaptive user interfaces**, heightening data subjects’ actual informedness about data-related practices and, thus, their sovereignty.

Altogether, our transparency information language and toolkit allow – differently from previous work – to express transparency information **in line with actual legal requirements and practices of modern (web) information systems engineering** and thereby pave the way for a multitude of novel possibilities to heighten transparency and user sovereignty in practice.
